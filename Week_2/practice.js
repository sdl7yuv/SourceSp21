//1. Write a traditional function that converts fahrenheit to celsius
console.log("test");
//2. Modify your function for #1 to be arrow syntax

//3. Write a one-line arrow function that takes in a number and returns a string stating whether the
//   number is positive or negative using a ternary operator (assume the number will never be zero)

//4. Write a switch statement for a 'day' variable that prints out something
// based off of what day of the week it is
// i.e. if its monday print "good luck" or wednesday print "hump day" or friday print "party"

//5. Write a function that takes in a number, and uses a for loop to
//return the sum of every number from 1 up to that number
//ex. sumUp(7) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7

//6. Write a function that takes in a number, and prints out every number up to and including that value.
//For each multiple of 3, instead print "fizz". For each multiple of 5, print "buzz". For numbers that
//are multiples of 3 AND 5, print "fizzbuzz"
//example output: 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz,

//7. Create an object for yourself with first Name, last Name,
//   a list of three of your family members' names, and age

//8. Write a function that takes in an array and prints out the amount of truthy values in that array
//   using .forEach()
const exampleArray = ["Hello, world!", 8, null, false, "", "0", -22];

//9. Using the map function and arrow syntax, return an array of objects
//   that contain a fullName field and an averageGrade field representing
//   the letter grade that corresponds to their GPA
